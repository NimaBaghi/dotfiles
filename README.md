I have a Thinkpad X1 extreme, and I had some major problems configuring the external monitor cause its hdmi port wired to the nvidia gpu directly.
Finally I solved the issue using these links, maybe useful for somebody else too.
I stopped thinking about hybrid graphic or some fancy thing like that, if it works I really will be happy :|
I used optimus-manager with bbswitch and followed this guide:

About my laptop:

and the newer version which has some helpful instructions too:
